This repository contains all codes from the various personal projects I have undertaken

## Covid Portfolio Project
A Data Exploratory Project, on the loss of lives experienced globally from the Covid-19 pandemic as well as the vaccination processes across all countries, using SQL.
With particular interest on Ghana, my home country and Canada, where I live currently. Link to the dataset: [Covid-19 Deaths](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths)

To view the data visualization I created, on the lives lost globally due to the Covid-19 pandemic, with Tableau: [Covid-19 Deaths Data Viz](https://public.tableau.com/views/Covid-19PortfolioProject_16228257633050/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

A data visualization on the global vaccinations will be available soon!
